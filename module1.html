              <h3>Induction Assignment:</h3>
              <p>Here is a link to the induction assignment essay that I wrote:</p>
              <p><a href="artefacts/Induction%20Assignment%20The%20importance%20of%20a%20postgraduate%20degree%20in%20the%20Cyber%20Security%20field.pdf">Induction
                  Assignment Essay</a></p>
              <h3>Coding Exercises:</h3>
              <p>The instructions given were:</p>
              <p> Code a function called 'first_div_16' ACCEPT two positive
                integers, n1 and n2, as inputs RETURN the first number in
                range(n1,n2) that is divisible by 16. HOWEVER, if no number in
                the range is divisible by 16 RETURN 0. Code a function called
                'halve_to_2' ACCEPT one numeric input. If the number &lt;= 0,
                RETURN -1. If the number &gt; 0, divide that integer
                over-and-over by 2 until it becomes smaller than 2. RETURN that
                smaller-than-2 number, e.g. input of 4 Will yield 1
                (4-&gt;2-&gt;1), 5 yields 1.25 (5-&gt;2.5-&gt;1.25) etc. Code a
                function called 'string_expansion'. ACCEPT a non-empty string as
                input RETURN a string that contains every other character, 2n+2
                times, where n is the original index of the letter. e.g. Input
                of "Hello" should result in "HHlllllloooooooooo". Input of
                "ROBErt" should result in "RRBBBBBBrrrrrrrrrr". Code a function
                called 'item_count_from_index'. ACCEPT two inputs, a list and an
                integer-index RETURN a count (number) of how many times the item
                at that index appears in the list. HOWEVER, if the integer-index
                is out of bounds for the list RETURN the empty string ("") (e.g.
                list of 3 items, index of 5 is out of bounds). Code a function
                called 'length_times_largest'. ACCEPT a list as input RETURN the
                length of the list times the largest integer (not float) in the
                list. HOWEVER, if the list does not contain an integer, RETURN
                the empty string (""). </p>
              <p> I coded all of the above functions. A PDF of the code can be
                found here: <a href="artefacts/thecode.py.pdf">Python
                  Program</a> </p>
              <h3>Collaborative Discussion 1:</h3>
              <p> Discuss why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is
                important for companies to invest in Cyber Security. Critically
                analyse the cyber security threats and vulnerabilities, the
                impact those vulnerabilities have on the organisation and the
                economic implications. </p>

              <h3>Artefact: Individual Essay</h3>
              <p> This assessment was aimed at assessing our ability to appraise
                critically and apply the concepts and principles of secure
                object-oriented design to facilitate business security-based
                decisions. </p>
              <p> As such, the deliverable in Unit 9 aimed to apply the Cyber
                Security methods and techniques studied during the module to
                develop a solution to a business problem. </p>
              <p>This required us to write up a detailed report on a web-based
                Appointment and Scheduling Management Information System (ASMIS)
                for a medical clinic based in Queens, specifically detailing the
                potential OOP design, and focusing on potential security risks
                and possible counter-measures to these risks. </p>
              <p> <a href="artefacts/ASMIS%20Cyber%20Threat%20and%20Mitigation%20Report.pdf">ASMIS
                  Cyber Threats and Mitigation Report</a> </p>
              <h3>Artefact: ASMIS Prototype System</h3>
              <p> Unit 12 ended off with instructions to implement a prototype
                of the ASMIS proposed in the ASMIS report, along with at least
                one security measure addressing one cyber-security risk
                identified in the report. My implementation is a
                fully-functional prototype ASMIS system. It provides all of the
                functionality to demonstrate basic appointment booking and
                consultation capturing. The main data of interest for hackers /
                cyber-criminals in such a system are the patient details and
                patient medical records. It is therefore of utmost importance to
                ensure that these data are secured as far as possible. All of
                the code and related resources can be found on my GitHub repo:</p>
              <p><a href="https://github.com/nmajola81/asmis-project">ASMIS
                  GitHub Repo</a></p>
              <p> I decided to generally incorporate and demonstrate the
                following security features: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A strict password policy (at least 8 characters long,
                  consisting of at least 1 upper-case, 1 lower-case, 1 special
                  and 1 numeric character) that would help mitigate the threat
                  of spoofing via brute force / dictionary attacks.</li>
                <li>Storing passwords in the form of salted hashes in the
                  database. This helps prevent information disclosure if the
                  database were to be breached; coupled with the strict password
                  policy, passwords with salted encryption provide extra
                  security, making it difficult for hackers to do a hash look
                  up.</li>
                <li>Extensive logging of all key actions in the system along
                  with exact date and time e.g. user login and logout
                  activities, to appointment booking, patient detail viewing,
                  patient consultation notes viewing, updating details etc. This
                  fosters an environment of responsible use; a malicious user
                  (especially Admin user) would be far more reluctant to engage
                  in abusive activities, knowing that every action is recorded
                  as having been carried out by that user.</li>
                <li>Admin user permission levels. For this prototype, a basic
                  access control system was provided whereby Admin users are
                  either permission level 2 i.e. Super Admin user, who will have
                  over-sight over other Admins, or a normal Admin user with
                  permission level 1 who has to obtain authorization from a
                  Super Admin for key activities that may be susceptible to
                  abuse. In practice a more extensive access control system
                  would need to be implemented to systematically control access
                  to a variety of activities.</li>
                <li>Multi-factor authentication to foster an environment of
                  consent and over-sight for key activities. i.e.:
                  <ul>
                    <li>When a Physician tries to access a patient's previous
                      consultation notes, an OTP is sent to the relevant
                      patient, and the Physician will only be granted access
                      with this OTP.</li>
                    <li>When an Admin user tries to view or edit a patient's
                      details, an OTP is sent to the relevant patient, and the
                      Admin user will only be granted access with this OTP.</li>
                    <li>When a normal Admin user (permission level 1) tries to
                      register a new Physician account or to Cancel an
                      appointment, an OTP is sent to the super Admin user
                      (permission level 2), and the normal Admin user will only
                      be granted access to these actions with this OTP.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>SQL injection protection by using standard SQL querying
                  libraries and using safe query practices in the form of safe
                  parameter substitution.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> I carried out testing of the system in terms of the above
                security features to ensure that they work correctly. This is
                documented in detail in the document below. </p>
