              tool for System Engineering? Read the article by Chabibi et al

              <p> <a href="#tocontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
              <p>For the implementation, after having gone through several
                iterations of code, I personally ended up contributing a very
                comprehensive IoT simulation to the group. The simulation
                includes a Server HUB which does the following:<br>
                1. It runs a server that listens for incoming connections from
                devices<br>
                2. When a device connects, it checks to see if it is registered;
                if not it registers it<br>
                3. It acts as a keypad / user interface with which the user can
                access functions on connected devices </p>
              <p> It also includes a simulated IoT devices service which can be
                set to simulate several different devices (currently
                MotionSensor, SmartLight, SmartLock and Thermostat). While it
                can be customized, for demo purposes, we've provided a list of
                pre-defined devices (which can be seamlessly added to) It does
                the following:<br>
                1. The user can specify one of the pre-defined devices to
                simulate<br>
                2. The simulated device then attempts to connect to the HUB
                (which should be already running)<br>
                3. If connection is successful, the device then waits for
                requests/instructions from the HUB and executes them as they
                come in<br>
                <br>
                Note: multiple instances of this module can be run at the same
                time to simulate multiple devices connecting to the HUB Also
                note: because this is a simulation, it is possible to select the
                same device in two or more instances of this script e.g.
                selecting Light1 in both/all; the HUB will simply take the most
                recent copy and connect to that. Below is a zip file containing
                mt contribution.</p>
