              <p> This activity aimed to induce reflection on the ethics of
                computing, which is, unfortunately, an aspect of computing that
                receives hardly any attention. The task involved placing oneself
                in the shoes of a computing professional working at an arbitrary
                company, and examining the effect of ethical issues on that role
                in the company, as well as reflecting on the actions that could
                be taken in response to those issues. </p>

              <p> This amazing exercise involved: picking a case study from the
                examples provided by the Association of <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies">Computing
                  Machinery (ACM)</a>; reviewing and applying the ethics code to
                the case study selected, making sure to point out the impact on
                relevant legal and social issues; and considering issues of
                professionalism of the computing professionals involved in the
                case study, making sure to draw comparisons to the Code of
                Conduct of the <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/">British
                  Computer Society (BCS)</a>. All this considered, the aim was
                to draw up an initial posting of at least 200 words long for
                review by peers in the course. </p>

              <p> <a href="#tocontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
              <p>A critical part of any research project is a literature review.
                The literature review is instrumental in uncovering work that
                has been done in a particular field. This helps determine gaps
                and potential areas which can be undertaken. The review also
                help provide crucial context to the research by providing an
                underpinning against which to compare results and artefacts
                produced in the research.</p>
              <p> In formulating my literature review, I first formulated an
                outline which I submitted for feedback. Below are the outline I
                submitted and subsequent feedback I received. </p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="artefacts/RMPPModule/Unit4/LiteratureReviewOutline.pdf"

                    title="Initial post" target="_blank">This is my initial
                    outline</a></li>

                    received</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p> Two main points of consideration in the feedback were to: to
                try to focus the literature review as much as possible; and to
                be consistent with mentioning 'pros' and 'cons' throughout the
                review. Accordingly, the following final literature review
                submission was formulated: </p>

                    received</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p> Overall, the literature review was very well received, with
                mostly 'Excellent' outcomes. Some of the points of feedback were
                to try to completely use my own academic voice to avoid any
                intext matches via Turnitin; and work towards developing even
                more critical discussion by carrying and comparing ideas across
                paragraphs. </p>

              <p> Unit 8 was an extremely useful deep-dive into the use of
                statistics to be able to scientifically test and verify (or
                reject) beliefs. I learnt a whole lot here, to be honest. I had
                always heard of a range of concepts like statistical tests,
                hypotheses, p-values etc., and this finally demystified me on
                these concepts.</p>

              <p> Unit 9 picked up where Unit 8 left off, with a detailed and
                systematic description of techniques to visualise data. Data
                visualisation is a key and crucial part of data analysis, since
                correct/effective visualisation of data allows for the
