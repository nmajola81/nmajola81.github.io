                Module:</h3>
              <p> <a href="#tocontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
              <p> As I reflect upon the completion of this module, I am reminded
                of the extensive skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout
                its duration. This module has undeniably played a pivotal role
                in shaping my comprehension of the intricate realm of technology
                research and the professional obligations and responsibilities
                that accompany it. In this reflective piece, I will delve into
                the key insights and transformations that have emerged from this
                educational journey.</p>
              <p> First and foremost, this module has instilled in me the
                paramount importance of formulating precise and research-worthy
                questions. This foundational skill has served as the compass
                guiding my literature review and refining my research proposal
                throughout the program. It has become abundantly clear that a
                well-crafted research question is the bedrock upon which all
                other aspects of a research project are founded, and upon which
                a successful paper is written. This perspective aligns with the
                scholarly wisdom of researchers such as Booth, Colomb, and
                Williams, who emphasise the centrality of precise questioning in
                their book "The Craft of Research" (2008).</p>
              <p> Moreover, this module places a strong emphasis on the art of
                conducting comprehensive literature reviews and synthesising
                research findings. This practice has significantly broadened my
                horizons, enabling me to navigate through the vast landscape of
                existing research, thereby equipping me to identify gaps and
                opportunities for further exploration. The ability to discern
                cutting-edge areas where I can make meaningful contributions is
                was invaluable. This emphasis on literature review aligns with
                the guidance provided by prominent scholars such as Hall in his
                work "The Postgraduate's Companion" (2008).</p>
              <p> Engaging in lectures, discussions, and case studies has
                heightened my awareness of the multifaceted challenges and
                responsibilities that confront computing professionals. It has
                allowed me to appreciate the ethical considerations, and social
                implications that accompany technological advancements. My
                understanding resonates with the insights of Johnson, who delves
                into the ethical dimensions of technology in her book "Computer
                Ethics" (2009).</p>
              <p> The process of designing research studies presented a
                distinctive challenge for me, as it required me to tap into a
                complex skillset. However, I discovered that meticulous planning
                and methodological rigor are indispensable for producing
                actionable research outcomes. This module has afforded me a
                deeper understanding of and appreciation for the meticulous work
                that underlies research design and data collection, aligning
                with the principles elucidated by scholars such as Leedy and
                Ormrod in their book "Practical Research: Planning and Design"
                (2020).</p>
              <p> I have come to understand that research proposals serve a
                multifaceted role. They function as a guiding compass, directing
                researchers through challenging terrain with ethical
                considerations and validations, and the delicate balance of
                technology and ethics.</p>
              <p> Furthermore, my exploration of this module has unveiled the
                significance of data quality and availability. This aspect
                closely resembles a treasure hunt, particularly in the context
                of real-time data collection from physical front-shop
                environments. Within this quest, the persistent specters of data
                noise and bias lurk, demanding vigilance and meticulous curation
                to safeguard against any distortion of the invaluable insights
                we seek to uncover.</p>
              <p> To overcome some of the research proposal presentation
                hurdles, I used various strategic approaches, such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Learning the power and necessity of clear and concise
                  language. By simplifying complex concepts into easily
                  digestible terms, ensures the message is easily communicated
                  to, and resonates with, the audience.</li>
                <li>Weaving narratives into relatable content, drawing the
                  audience into the world of real-time customer experience
                  tracking and sentiment analysis.</li>
                <li>Visuals are a potent tool. I have harnessed the magic of
                  graphics to break down intricate ideas. These visuals serve as
                  guides, helping my audience navigate the depths of my
                  research.</li>
                <li>Real-world examples breathe life into theory. I have also
                  learnt to incorporate these practical scenarios, showcasing
                  how sentiment analysis can be applied in everyday situations.</li>
                <li>Practice, practice, practice. In rehearsing my presentation
                  numerous times and with each run-through, refined delivery and
                  timing, ensuring messages are conveyed effectively.</li>
              </ul>
              Through this module and my independent research efforts in
              preparation for the literature review and proposal drafting, I
              gained knowledge in advanced data analysis techniques, including
              sentiment analysis and machine learning. This expanded toolkit
              equips me with the ability to extract valuable insights from
              complex research data, and I am eagerly anticipating the
              opportunity to apply these techniques in future endeavors. This
              aligns with the evolving landscape of research methodologies in
              the field of technology and computing.<br>
              <br>
              Perhaps one of the most significant takeaways from this module has
              been the refinement of my communication and literature scripting
              skills within the academic context. The ability to convey ideas
              effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences has
              proven to be indispensable. Engaging in collaborative discussions
              and participating in peer reviews with fellow students has further
              solidified my grasp of the core principles that this module aims
              to impart. By summarising information and sharing insights, I have
              honed my communication skills and have become increasingly adept
              at explaining intricate concepts in a clear and accessible manner.<br>
              <br>
              Throughout all of this, the invaluable feedback of the
              knowledgeable course instructor served as a guiding voice with
              which to navigate this intricate field. I admit that I was in awe
              as to how she manages to carefully go through the submissions of
              so many students, and yet still meticulously provide precise and
              detailed feedback. I deeply appreciate her tireless efforts in
              helping to improve my learning journey.<br>
              <br>
              In summary, this module has induced a profound transformation on
              my perspective on research methodologies, advanced analytical
              techniques, and professional standards within the realm of

              <p> This activity aimed to induce reflection on the ethics of
                computing, which is, unfortunately, an aspect of computing that
                receives hardly any attention. The task involved placing oneself
                in the shoes of a computing professional working at an arbitrary
                company, and examining the effect of ethical issues on that role
                in the company, as well as reflecting on the actions that could
                be taken in response to those issues. </p>
              <p>This activity was one of the first activities in the module and
                centered on the ethics of computing which provided me with
                crucial insights and skills. I got introduced to, and developed
                a heightened awareness of, the ethical challenges that computing
                professionals can encounter in their roles, including issues
                related to data privacy, security, and social responsibility.
                This exercise honed my ability to identify ethical dilemmas,
                assess their impact on both individuals and the organization,
                and consider appropriate courses of action. It reinforced the
                significance of ethical decision-making and the role of
                professional codes of conduct in guiding behavior. These
                insights and skills will guided me in navigating complex ethical
                issues and promoting responsible computing practices, which
                continued to be themes across the module.</p>

                  Machinery (ACM)</a>; reviewing and applying the ethics code to
                the case study selected, making sure to point out the impact on
                relevant legal and social issues; and considering issues of
                professionalism of the computing professionals involved in the
                case study, making sure to draw comparisons to the Code of
                Conduct of the <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/">British
                  Computer Society (BCS)</a>. All this considered, the aim was
                to draw up an initial posting of at least 200 words long for
                review by peers in the course. </p>
              <p>The domain that I found fascinating was that of <strong>medical
                  implants</strong>, as it has so much potential for good, but
                at the same time, is a field with complex and far-reaching
                ethical and legal considerations. During my exploration of the
                ethical considerations surrounding medical implants, I gained
                valuable insights and skills related to the application of
                ethical codes, legal implications, social impact, and
                professionalism of computing professionals. First and foremost,
                I learnt the significance of applying ethical principles in the
                development and use of medical implants. The British Computer
                Society (BCS) Code of Conduct emphasizes the responsibility of
                computing professionals to prioritize the well-being and safety
                of individuals and society when designing and implementing
                technological solutions. This aligns with the ethical principles
                in the medical field, where patient welfare is paramount.</p>
              <p>I also discovered the complex legal landscape surrounding
                medical implants, which can vary from one jurisdiction to
                another. Understanding the legal requirements and regulations
                applicable to medical devices is crucial to ensure compliance
                and minimize legal risks. Additionally, I recognized that
                staying informed about evolving legal frameworks is an essential
                skill for computing professionals involved in this domain.<br>
                <br>
                Moreover, I became aware of the profound societal implications
                of medical implants. They can significantly improve patients'
                quality of life but also raise concerns about privacy, security,
                and accessibility. Computing professionals must be attuned to
                these societal factors and work collaboratively with healthcare
                experts to address them effectively. Lastly, professionalism in
                this context entails not only technical competence but also a
                commitment to ethical conduct, ongoing education, and a
                collaborative approach to solve complex problems. The BCS Code
                of Conduct highlights these aspects, emphasizing the importance
                of continuous professional development and ethical behavior.

                Inappropriate Surveys:</h3>
              <p> <a href="#tocontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
              <p> This was another thought-provoking reflective activity on the
                topic of inappropriate surveys. Inappropriate surveys have made
                International headlines and are very important to discuss. </p>
              <p>Creating a case study on inappropriate surveys was a valuable
                learning experience that enriched my insights and skills in
                several ways. First, researching and compiling the case study
                allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the intricacies of
                survey design, administration, and ethical considerations. I had
                to explore real-world examples, academic literature, and best
                practices to construct a comprehensive and informative case.</p>
              <p>Second, this task sharpened my critical thinking skills as I
                had to evaluate the ethical dilemmas, potential biases, and
                consequences associated with inappropriate surveys. It required
                me to analyze situations from multiple perspectives, considering
                the impact on respondents, organizations, and the broader
                community.</p>
              <p>Additionally, writing the case study enhanced my communication
                skills. I had to once again present complex information in a
                clear and concise manner, ensuring that the ethical issues and
                their implications were effectively conveyed to the reader.</p>
              <p>Finally, this exercise emphasized the importance of ethical
                research and survey practices. It underscored the responsibility
                we have as computing professionals to ensure that data
                collection methods are respectful, fair, and aligned with
                ethical principles.</p>
              <p>Below is a case study I wrote on this topic:</p>

              <p> This was a fascinating and thought provoking activity that
                required us to put into practice the information gathered in
                Unit 6 involving the design of questionnaires. Questionnaires
                are invaluable element in research; they are used to gather data
                from research participants. The design of questionnaires is
                crucial to effective data analysis; a poorly designed
                questionnaire will result in data that is difficult to analyse
                and/or interprete.</p>

                      underscored the importance of careful questionnaire
                      construction in gathering meaningful data. I learnt to
                      evaluate the relevance and clarity of each question,
                      considering whether they aligned with the research
                      objectives. Additionally, I honed my ability to identify
                      biases, leading questions, or ambiguities that could
                      compromise data quality.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, this task encouraged me to think critically
                      about survey formatting, including the logical flow of
                      questions and the use of response scales. It highlighted
                      the significance of creating a user-friendly and engaging

              <p> <a href="#tocontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
              <p> This was the second amazing collaborative exercise that
                involved a deeply thought-provoking activity in the form of a
                scenario involving a researcher that finds themselves in a
                difficult ethical situation: arriving at results that are
                unfavourable to their employer. Engaging with the ethical
                dilemmas presented in the case study involving Abi, the
                researcher and statistical programmer, has significantly
                expanded my insights and skills in several crucial areas. First,
                the task continued on the theme of the complexities of research
                ethics, particularly the importance of data integrity and
                honesty in reporting findings. It highlighted the ethical
                responsibility that researchers have in maintaining the accuracy
                and credibility of their work, even when the results may not
                align with the interests of stakeholders (in the extreme case,
                an employer).</p>
              <div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full">

                  <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">
                    <p>Additionally, considering the legal implications of Abi's
                      choices underscored the significance of research
                      compliance with local and international regulations. It
                      emphasized the potential legal consequences of
                      manipulating data or presenting biased analyses, further
                      emphasizing the need for ethical research conduct. The
                      case study also shed light on the social impact of
                      unethical research practices. Misleading data analysis not
                      only harms public trust but also potentially endangers
                      consumers' health in this context. It reinforced the
                      broader societal implications of ethical lapses in
                      research.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the discussion around Abi's professional
                      responsibilities emphasized the importance of upholding
                      ethical standards within one's field. It made me reflect
                      on the role of professional codes of conduct, such as
                      those from statistical and research organizations, in
                      guiding ethical behavior. In conclusion, this task
                      deepened my understanding of the multifaceted nature of
                      ethical dilemmas in research and the far-reaching
                      consequences of unethical conduct. It reinforced the
                      importance of integrity, transparency, and ethical
                      decision-making in the realm of research and professional
                      practice, skills that I will carry with me in my academic
                      and professional journey.</p>

              <p> <a href="#tocontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
              <p>A critical part of any research project is a literature review.
                The literature review is instrumental in uncovering work that
                has been done in a particular field. This helps determine gaps
                and potential areas which can be undertaken. The review also
                help provide crucial context to the research by providing an
                underpinning against which to compare results and artefacts
                produced in the research.</p>
              <p> In formulating my literature review, I first formulated an
                outline which I submitted for feedback. Below are the outline I
                submitted and subsequent feedback I received. </p>
              <ul>

              </ul>
              <p> Two main points of consideration in the feedback were to: to
                try to focus the literature review as much as possible; and to
                be consistent with mentioning 'pros' and 'cons' throughout the
                review. Accordingly, the following final literature review
                submission was formulated: </p>

                    received</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p> Overall, the literature review was very well received, with
                mostly 'Excellent' outcomes. Some of the points of feedback were
                to try to completely use my own academic voice to avoid any
                in-text matches via Turnitin; and work towards developing even
                more critical discussion by carrying and comparing ideas across
                paragraphs. </p>
              <p>Writing a literature review has been a deeply enlightening
                experience, enriching my insights and honing essential skills,
                including: finding a salient topic, engaging with academic
                sources; pruning the large quantity of academic sources to find
                those that are most relevant; organising the knowledge in a
                logical and sensible manner; writing up the information in a
                similarly logical and sensible manner; and using the information
                to identify gaps and salient areas for future research . Through
                this task, I've developed a deep understanding of the existing
                research landscape on the chosen topic, but more importantly, on
                undertaking this activity in any field. I've learnt to
                critically evaluate scholarly articles, identify key trends, and
                synthesize findings effectively. This process has refined my
                research skills, enabling me to navigate vast academic
                literature efficiently. Moreover, crafting a literature review
                has strengthened my ability to structure and organize complex
                information coherently, enhancing my writing and communication
                skills. These insights and skills will undoubtedly benefit me in
                future academic endeavors, research projects, and professional
                contexts, allowing me to contribute meaningfully to the
                scholarly discourse. While I think these trends are probably
                similar across all the students, I personally benefitted from
                being submerged into the world of research after decades of
                being in industry, and this was very fulfilling.</p>
              <h3 id="stats1">Summary Measures and Hypothesis Testing
                Worksheets:</h3>
              <p> <a href="#tocontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
              <p> Unit 8 was an extremely useful deep-dive into the use of
                statistics to be able to scientifically test and verify (or
                reject) beliefs. I learnt a whole lot here, to be honest. I had
                always heard of a range of concepts like statistical tests,
                hypotheses, p-values etc., and this finally demystified me on
                these concepts. I especially felt fulfilled when I understood
                (after having heard these terms numerous times in the past)
                two-tailed and one-tailed test results. I gained a deep
                understanding of how to summarize and interpret data
                effectively, including measures of central tendency and
                variability. Moreover, I acquired the ability to apply
                inferential statistics to draw meaningful conclusions from
                limited sample data. This involved hypothesis formulation,
                selecting appropriate statistical tests, and interpreting
                p-values and confidence intervals. These skills have empowered
                me to make data-driven decisions and critically evaluate
                research findings, enhancing my analytical and problem-solving
                capabilities, which are invaluable in various academic and
                professional domains where data analysis is essential. To be
                honest, I now look at data sets a bit differently; I find myself
                immediately thinking about the hypotheses that can be formulated
                and how I can set about proving (or disproving) them.</p>
              <p>I can't say that I feel like an expert thought, since my
                research when trying to get through this task revealed a whole
                host of further intricacies involved ,which I'm interested to
                delve into.</p>
              <p> I initially submitted only my document with my analyses on all
                Unit 8 worksheet tasks but didn't submit the worksheets. Our
                knowledgeable course instructor then provided <a href="artefacts/RMPPModule/Unit8and9/Nomusa_Majola_formative%20Feedback_Template_%28Statistical%20worksheet%29.pdf"
                  target="_blank"> valuable formative feedback</a>. The main
                point of improvement was to add in the graphs (and I assume
                results) in the worksheets into the document with my analyses,
                which I did. </p>
              <p> Below, are the extremely useful and systematic worksheets
                given to us, along with my <b>final document</b> with analyses
                that includes the graphs and results, to work through to set the

              <p> <a href="#tocontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
              <p> Unit 9 picked up where Unit 8 left off, with a detailed and
                systematic description of techniques to visualise data. Data
                visualisation is a key and crucial part of data analysis, since
                correct/effective visualisation of data allows for the
                researcher to quickly observe trends and carry out comparisons.
                This has been instrumental in enhancing my insights and skills
                related to effectively conveying information through graphical
                representation, and I was very impressed with how well the two
                units (8 and 9) went hand-in-hand and how well-thought-out and
                well-structured they were. I've learnt how to choose the most
                suitable visualizations for different types of data, such as bar
                charts and histograms plots to reveal patterns and trends
                efficiently. Additionally, I gained an understanding of the
                principles of good data visualization, including clarity,
                accuracy, and context. This knowledge has empowered me to
                present data in a more engaging and informative manner, aiding
                in rapid trend identification and facilitating effective
                communication in both research and professional contexts. The
                ability to harness data visualization tools and techniques is
                invaluable for making data-driven decisions and insights. Here,
                again, I don't feel at all like an expert, but this has been an
                excellent start to a journey in the field of data analysis and
                visualisation.</p>
              <p> As with Unit 8, I initially submitted only my Unit 9 analysis
                document which didn't have any of the worksheet results or
                graphs in it; I didn't submit the worksheets. Our knowledgeable
                course instructor then provided <a href="artefacts/RMPPModule/Unit8and9/Unit_8_Exercises/Nomusa_Majola_formative%20Feedback_Template_%28Statistical%20worksheet%29.pdf"
                  target="_blank"> valuable formative feedback</a> and, as with
                Unit 8, the main point of improvement was to add in the graphs
                (and I assume results) in the worksheets into the document with
                my analyses, which I did. </p>
              <p> Below, are the brilliant systematic worksheets provided to us,

              <h3 id="resprop">Research Proposal Presentation:</h3>
              <p> <a href="#tocontents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
              <p> This task gave me excellent practice into designing and
                presenting a research proposal, and it was a perfect integration
                of all previous concepts discussed in the module. Among other
                things, it required for a formulation of a research problem, a
                literature review, and careful consideration of the intended
                experimentation. I decided to align closely to the topic that I
                had chosen for my literature review (namely, sentiment analysis
                using deep learning) since I had developed a good understanding
                of that field. However, I decided to streamline and focus the
                topic into a specific domain and I settled on "Real-Time
                Customer Experience Tracking in Front-Shops using Deep Sentiment
                Analysis". </p>
              <p> This is a specific area of sentiment analysis that aims to
                harness deep learning models to assist businesses in tracking
                their customer experience (CX) perception. This has been done at
                scale to track business' CX at a large scale, but studies
                attempting this at a more fine-grained level to determine how
                their front-shops are performing are rare. Below, you can find
                my final presentation, along with my manuscript </p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="artefacts/RMPPModule/Unit10/Research_Proposal_Presentation.pptx"

              </ul>
              <p> I admit that this task was extremely challenging specifically
                because of the time limit. There was a LOT to say and very
                limited time. I initially had a manuscript with close to 2300
                words. When I tried to narrate this onto the slides, I took
                close to 50 minutes!!! Needless to say, I began to cut down the
                manuscript significantly, each time narrating over the slides.
                Strategising areas to cut down was very challenging. Every
                section seemed no less important than any other section... When
                it came to the related work slides, I tried to retain as much of
                the theory in these slide as I could. </p>
              <p>Ultimately, I ended up recording and re-recording the
                manuscript some 30 - 40 times!!</p>
              <p> I received <a href="artefacts/RMPPModule/Unit10/Final_323489_RRMP_Summative_Feedback_Template_%28Research%20Proposal%20Presentation%29.pdf"
                  title="PPT" target="_blank">valuable feedback</a> from the
                course instructor. The main points for improvement were: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>To try to draw more theory into the presentation. As
                  mentioned previously, I did try to do this, but the time limit
                  made this challenging. This just demonstrates how much of an
                  important exercise this actually was! Presentations in real
                  life will always have time limits, and learning to say
                  everything concisely is a critical skill to have. </li>
                <li>To work on my voice intonation while presenting. Here again,
                  I admit that, after having redone the narration some 30 to 40
                  times, I was exhausted and this led to the voice intonation in
                  the slides. I will improve!</li>
