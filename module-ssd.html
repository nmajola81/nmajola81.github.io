                    <h2>Module #3: Secure Software Development</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>About:</h3>
                    <p> This module is an exciting module that delves deep into the
                        heart of cyber security by looking at security risks in
                        programming languages, including design and architecture,
                        programming paradigms, testing, the impact of operating systems
                        and libraries, risks in distributed systems and APIs, and future
                        trends in secure software design, all within the context of the
                        secure software development life cycle. </p>
                    <h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
                    <p> The module has the following intended learning outcomes: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify and manage security risks as part of a software
                            development project.
                        </li>
                        <li>Critically analyse development problems and determine
                            appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including
                            program design and development) to solve them.
                        </li>
                        <li>Design and develop/adapt computer programs and to produce a
                            solution that meets the design brief and critically evaluate
                            solutions that are produced.
                        </li>
                        <li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to
                            be effective member of a development team in a virtual
                            professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on
                            team roles and organisation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Reflective Piece:</h3>
                    <p> This module was quite possibly the most interesting, stimulating and enjoyable so far. As a
                        culmination of all the theory we’ve learnt so far in other modules, this module provided a
                        practical assignment to “put it all together”. Aside from smaller tasks cleverly designed to
                        provide exposure to a range of security-based concepts e.g. buffer overflows, linters etc., the
                        module had a project that required us to take a real-world problem and develop a secure web
                        application for it.</p>
                    <p>

                        The project was very cleverly divided into two parts. The first part required us to create a
                        design document in which we laid out the design of the proposed application. There were two very
                        useful aspects to this. First, this required us to carefully investigate the problem domain and
                        consider the possibilities as regards vulnerabilities and security issues. Second, I really
                        appreciated that, while we were placed into teams, the module lecturer required each team member
                        to prepare a separate document. This meant that I was able to give the problem comprehensive
                        attention, and not just focus on a few things, which was invaluable learning time. One key
                        aspect that I’m focusing on is to try and get over various learning curves which are usually the
                        most difficult part of learning something new.</p>
                    <p>Our application was a web application for reporting vulnerabilities to the National Cyber
                        Security Centre (NCSC) of the government of the Netherlands. When it came to the design, and
                        given a lack of access to the NCSC itself, I decided to gather information from the NCSC website
                        (NCSC, n.d.) to determine how the process of collecting information on vulnerabilities work, as
                        well as what kind of information is gathered. Once I had this information and had summarised it,
                        it was about using the knowledge that I gained from previous modules around security analysis
                        techniques and frameworks such as STRIDE (Kaufman et al., 1998) and the Open Web Application
                        Security Project’s OWASP Top 10 security vulnerability list (OWASP, 2021), to analyse the
                        problem domain. One significant challenge was the word limit. There was so much to say and
                        figuring out how to say it concisely was a good part of the challenge, and this was obviously
                        intended; it’s important to be able to take complex ideas and express them concisely.</p>
                    <p>I appreciated the individualised feedback that we received from the lecturer (also appreciating
                        just how much work this would have been on her part!) The team work aspect was also valuable as
                        it required us to take three viewpoints (with some overlap) and deliberate and negotiate what
                        stays and what goes, and what goes where. This was all valuable learning time.</p>
                    <p>When it came to coding, I must admit that it was a challenging experience of “learning curves
                        upon learning curves within learning curves towards learning curves…” There were so many
                        technologies to put together. At the most basic, it was about using Python, web servers,
                        javascript, HTML, CSS, databases and SQL; but then it was about specific frameworks such as
                        Flask (Grinberg, 2018), SQLAlchemy (Bayer and O’Meara, 2006), the SQLite “dialect” of SQL
                        (Owens, 2010), Bootstrap (Kent et al., 2016), jQuery (Chaffer and Swedberg, 2013), among others…
                        I obviously had to prioritize what I would learn more comprehensively (Flask, SQLite and
                        Bootstrap) and what I would just learn enough to get things done in the short time available
                        (jQuery, CSS).</p>
                    <p>I was really glad that my team mate came out with a very basic non-functional Flask and
                        Bootstrap template that we could use, which I used as a basis on which to build on. At first,
                        and for a while, the going was very slow. I found myself spending a lot of time just trying to
                        make very basic things work, such as defining a simple route, passing parameters, displaying
                        those parameters. I was probably doing Internet searches by the hundreds, if not thousands, on a
                        daily basis. As time went by, and as I got over the initial tough learning curve with Flask and
                        SQLAlchemy, I found myself really falling in love with these super powerful yet clean, modular
                        and simple frameworks. I started by implementing user registration, followed by user login. I
                        then progressed to report creation. Figuring out how to encrypt the data was really interesting;
                        I decided to assign each user a secure key of their own so that if one user’s key leaked, other
                        user’s reports/information would still be safe.</p>
                    <p>Once I got it working, (it is an understatement to say that) it was deeply satisfying to view
                        the SQLite database using the small nifty lightweight application called “DB Browser for SQLite”
                        (Zhou and Wei, 2019) and see nothing but a bunch of gibberish in the Report table, but then
                        logging in and viewing a nice readable report through the app. A few weeks and 28 commits later,
                        I had a fully functional app and it honestly felt (and still feels) absolutely amazing seeing
                        this full-functional “living breathing” application. I especially still feel elated when I
                        access the account page of a specific user that has posted many reports and messages, and then
                        click on a message in the messages list on that page and watch as the app jumps to the messaging
                        page and highlights the message. This was a feature that really frustrated me to the point of
                        wanting to abandon it, but eventually got it working.</p>
                    <p>I also found myself feeling a deep sense of appreciation for all the developers out there that
                        have volunteered so much of their time creating amazing and secure frameworks like Flask,
                        SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap and others, which can readily and freely be used to create amazing
                        applications in a fraction of the time it would have taken without them.</p>
                    <p>All in all, at the end of this amazing module, I feel a real sense of accomplishment, growth and
                        satisfaction, and am thankful for the experience that this has given me.</p>
