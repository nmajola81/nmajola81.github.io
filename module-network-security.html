              <h2>Module #3: Network Security</h2>
              <p></p>
              <h3>About:</h3>
              <p> This module is a brilliant and informative module that
                discusses the cyber security of network systems and designs. The
                module introduces and describes key techniques and to assess the
                vulnerability of networks which is at the heart of cyber
                security and cyber defense. These techniques are then
                practically implemented in the form of practical scanning
                activities in which the vulnerabilities of a website are
                assessed and discovered, and consideration is given to ways and
                means of mitigating those vulnerabilities. All in all, a crucial
                part of the cyber security toolkit. </p>
              <h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
              <p> The module has the following intended learning outcomes: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Understand the fundamentals of vulnerability assessment in
                  various systems.</li>
                <li>Understand of the fundamentals of the provision of security
                  in information networks.</li>
                <li>Be aware of the various protocols and architectures used by
                  various network systems.</li>
                <li>An understanding of the use and benefits of various
                  monitoring and logging tools</li>
                <li>An understanding of how to create and use security
                  vulnerability and assessment tools.</li>
                <li>The ability to present critical arguments for specific
                  actions or outcomes to a diverse audience.</li>
                <li>The opportunity to reflect on and evaluate their personal
                  development.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Reflective Piece:</h3>
              <p> The module was a high-paced module spanning only a few weeks,
                with a lot of very crucially important information on tools
                required to further add to my cyber security toolkit. The module
                dealt with a key aspect of cyber security which is network
                security. I was fascinated to learn early on in the module that
                the term “network security” is a deceptively concise term which
                encompasses a whole landscape involving the security of the
                networks themselves, that of all devices connected to those
                networks, the software running on those devices, as well as
                procedures, protocols and regulations devised to enhance cyber
                security and mitigate cyber security threats. But it doesn’t
                stop there; even the people operating those devices can
                contribute or actively threaten network security. I found all
                this very fascinating and at the same time in awe of the
                complexity of the field, and to be honest, wondering at how the
                digital world remains in tact.</p>
              <p>It also became clear, much to my fascination, that cyber
                security is something that you <strong>do</strong> and less
                something that you <strong>have</strong> i.e. as an
                organization, it is important to continuously and regularly
                reassess all networks, devices, software, protocols, procedures,
                regulations and, crucially, the people on those networks, as the
                passage of time can and does actively introduce newer threats
                and vulnerabilities, and associated protocols, software, devices
                and regulations. </p>
              <p> I took special interest in the regulatory side of the cyber
                security discipline given that I am currently actively involved
                in the legal discipline.</p>
              <p>I especially appreciated the practical component to the module.
                It started simple with basic scanning exercises using simple
                tools such as nmap, traceroute and Kali Linux. Being from a
                non-cyber-security background, all of these tools were new to
                me, and there were challenges galore. Each tool had it’s own
                nuances which I had to develop a feel for. Initially, I found it
                quite challenging to get Kali Linux up and running, but once I
                had considered a whole range of different options, I settled on
                making use of a Kali Linux image in Virtual Box. From here, the
                difficulties were around using Linux which was completely new to
                me. The OS looks deceptively similar to Windows, but it behaves
                quite differently.</p>
              <p>When trying to run some of the basic scans such as Nmap and
                traceroute, one challenge I faced was that the scan seemed to be
                unsuccessful and terminate without providing any results. A lot
                of online searching eventually led me to the realization that:
                a) using Kali Linux in a virtual machine for scanning purposes
                requires for a careful consideration to the network
                configuration of the virtual machine (Bridged more worked for
                me); and b) my allocated website (https://bookacheckup.co.uk)
                had a really sophisticated Intrusion Detection and Prevention
                System (IDPS) running which would block suspicious traffic,
                essentially blocking my scans. All of this was valuable learning
                time for me. It is learning curves like this that one must climb
                over before becoming proficient in a specific field.</p>
              <p>And as a natural progression from the basic scans, the module
                introduced a vulnerability assessment task on the same website.
                I appreciated that this was very logically broken down into two
                parts. First, we were required to do a baseline analysis and
                plan in which I found myself having to carefully put together
                all of the knowledge I had gained up to that point, as well as a
                careful yet high level inspection of the website to determine
                what <em>could</em> potentially be wrong and how I could go
                about fixing it. It was a very natural, clever and logical
                assembly of the module contents up to that point.</p>
              <p>Following that was a final logical concluding component to
                build on and complete the module in the form of an
                implementation of the baseline plan to carry out an analysis of
                the allocated website. The goal here was, both, to detect
                security vulnerabilities, as well as non-compliance to security
                regulations, chief of which is the GDPR.</p>
              <p>This was a very challenging task. I investigated the use of a
                range of different tools. The main challenge here was the wide
                differences in the means of obtaining, installing, using and
                interpreting each of these tools. Version mismatches and
                incorrect parameters caused a lot of problems e.g. when trying
                to get a penetration tool called Arachni to work, it simply
                refused to work with the available version of Chrome, and
                updating it’s own Chrome plugin didn’t help either. Another
                example: after installing it, an attempt to run OWASP ZAP
                required a very specific Java Runtime Environment. When trying
                to get BURP Suite to intercept communications between my browser
                and the website when submitting a POST query, BURP suite simply
                didn’t seem to like my browser version. This was all invaluable
                learning time, and although I admittedly have not solved some
                (actually many) of these issues yet and I have a whole of
                learning to do, I have begun that journey, which is arguably a
                crucial part of the journey.</p>
              <p>Eventually, I ended up using hostedscan.com which runs many of
                these tools (OWASP ZAP, OpenVAS, Nmap and Sslyze) and provides
                vulnerability results. Although the service also checks for SQL
                injection and XSS vulnerabilities, I decided to persist and get
                SQLMap to work, which I did on Kali Linux. I managed to test
                three of the text fields for SQL Injections. It was deeply
                satisfying to see it actually working, but slightly
                disappointing that there didn’t seem be any issues, but the
                learning experience was useful nonetheless.</p>
              <p>All in all, I’ve started on the journey into this broad and
                deep field and aim to continue to learn to use a range of tools
                as well as learn about a range of regulations towards improving
                my cyber security toolkit. I also look forward to the remaining
                modules in the programme. </p>
